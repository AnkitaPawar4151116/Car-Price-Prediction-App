# 🚗 Car Price Prediction App

A simple and intuitive **machine learning web application** that predicts the fair resale price of a used car based on its specifications. Built using **Streamlit** and a trained regression model.

---

## 📌 Features

- Predicts used car prices based on:
  - Car company
  - Model name
  - Year of manufacture
  - Kilometers driven
  - Fuel type
- Easy-to-use web interface with **Streamlit**
- Trained using **Multiple Linear Regression** and real-world data
- Handles user input errors gracefully

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Model type**: Multiple Linear Regression
- **Data source**: Cleaned dataset of used cars
- **Preprocessing**:
  - One-hot encoding of categorical features (`company`, `name`, `fuel_type`)
  - Numerical features (`year`, `kms_driven`) passed through
- **Trained pipeline** is saved as: `CarProject.pkl`
